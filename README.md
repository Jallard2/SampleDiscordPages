# SampleDiscordPages
## Overview
This is a discord bot that I madeto help store example pages to some relevant data structures created by the discord.py library in version 2.0. This allows for views, hybrid commands, slash commands, normal commands and will expand to allow for more types of data and relevant examples to be stored here

## Status
This is a continually work in progress and as I create more and work with discord bots more, I will add more details here as well as create a more detailed documentation
